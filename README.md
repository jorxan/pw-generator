this website is designed to generate a completely random password.
It takes the user's input for variables like the length they want the password to be, and whether or not they want to have capital letters, lowercase letters, numbers, or symbols, in their randomized password. The user then has the option to copy their password to their clipboard. 

There are some parameters set that the user has to abide by, those being that they cannot create a password that is less than 8 characters or over 128 characters. The user also has to select at least 1 character type for their password to be made up of. Other than that the password is completely randomized.
